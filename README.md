# VC-Version-Library

> "This DLL exports two functions, one to detect GTA: Vice City version, another to adjust an offset of GTA: VC 1.0 US to any existing GTA: VC version. This is useful for writers of trainers or other programs which directly access VC memory. GTA Liberty City Launcher uses this library."
